  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Maybin, Mwelwa. I was born on the 21<sup>st</sup>November, 1995 in the city of Ndola.
  The Continent where I was born from is Africa, and the specific Country is Zambia, which is located at the 
  south-central part of the African Continent.</p>
  
  <p>I was introduced to the world of coding when five years ago, and I have learnt many things in the tech industry
    from many mentors, Including Dr. Angela Yu, who has been one of my inspiration in the world of programming
    especially in the area of python programming. I am still learning and I am more passionate about learning and I would 
    want to become someone of value to the society and the world at large through the use of Technology.
  </p>
  
  <p>Apart from coding, I am also a classical flute player, but not really a professional one, but someone who can really 
    play some peices of classical music, like Pyrates of the Carribean, Mozart, Handel.,etc. I am a humble and an
    open minded individual and patient in learning until i reach to the highest level.
